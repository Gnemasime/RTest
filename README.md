# RTest
R  assessment from invisible technologies
# R Test 1:
We have two sets of login data for Invisible's system. The first set is in a table format where each entry includes an ID, the person's name, and a verification status. For instance, the first entry has an ID of "1", the name is "Alice", and the verification status is "True", indicating the account is verified. The second entry has an ID of "2", the name is "Bob", and the verification status is "False", showing that the account hasn't been verified yet.



The second set of data is organized more simply in a matrix form, pairing each ID with a password. The first ID, number "1", has a password of "09122018", and the second ID, number "2", has a password of "18122022".



We need to merge these two sets of data so that each person's ID, name, and password are in one table, keeping the verification status information as well.

# R Test 2:
Develop a function in R to generate a Pascalâ€™s Triangle. Ensure the function can correctly render the triangle for at least five rows.
